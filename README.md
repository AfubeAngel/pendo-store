# Timbu Cloud Shop (pendo-shop)

Welcome to the Pendo Shop project! This project is part of the HNG Internship stage 2 task, where I collaborated with a designer to bring their shop page design to life using Next.js.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a responsive e-commerce website that showcases products with clear descriptions and images. It includes a static checkout page and is designed to be fully responsive across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **ESLint**: Tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
